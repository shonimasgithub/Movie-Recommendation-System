Personalized AI Movie Recommendation System

Movie Recommendation System: An Intelligent AI-Powered Content-Based Suggestion Platform

Overview:
The Movie Recommendation System is a smart, AI-driven web application designed to help users discover movies that match their unique tastes and preferences. Developed as a mini project by a group of Computer Science students, this system focuses on solving the problem of choice overload faced by users on modern streaming platforms by providing personalized movie suggestions.
Key Objectives:
Analyze movie content and metadata to understand intrinsic similarities between movies.

Leverage user preferences, such as favourite genres, actors, or directors.

Overcome the limitations of collaborative filtering by handling cold-start problems effectively.

Enhance user engagement and viewing satisfaction by providing relevant, diverse, and insightful movie recommendations.

Present recommendations through a simple, interactive web interface.

Core Features:
✅ Content-Based Filtering:

Uses movie metadata (genre, cast, director, keywords) to match movies with user preferences.
✅ User Input Options:

Allows users to specify favourite actors, directors, or genres for more refined suggestions.
✅ Sentiment Analysis (Optional):

Analyses audience reviews to gauge sentiment, adding emotional context to recommendations.
✅ Simple User Flow:

Home Page: Users access the system and start the recommendation process.

Preference Page: Users enter their movie interests and favourite criteria.

Recommendation Page: The system displays a tailored list of recommended movies.

Technical Implementation:
Programming Language: Python (for backend logic and model implementation).

Web Framework: Flask (handles HTTP requests and serves recommendations to the frontend).

Preprocessing & Modelling: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for designing intuitive, interactive pages.

AJAX & JSON: Enable asynchronous communication between frontend and backend for dynamic user experiences.

Recommendation Algorithm: A content-based filtering model that compares user input with movie metadata to generate accurate suggestions.

Stakeholders:
Users: Primary beneficiaries seeking personalized movie recommendations.

Content Providers/Streaming Platforms: Can integrate the system to boost content discovery and user retention.

Developers & Data Scientists: Maintain and enhance the system for accuracy and scalability.

UX Designers: Ensure an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

Product Managers & Analysts: Optimize system performance and align with business goals.

Deployment & Scalability:
The system can be deployed on any web server or integrated into existing streaming platforms. Its design is scalable to handle growing user bases and large movie datasets.
